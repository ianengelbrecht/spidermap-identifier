## SpiderMap identifier

Since we've lost the VM, we need to identify records submitted through the BSA website which we never got to on the VM. 

This is a basic sveltekit app that steps through records on our firebase database, checks for the same record in the VM database, and shows records that
have not been identified. 

We might build this out later with more functionality to help with finalizing identifications for the Atlas.
